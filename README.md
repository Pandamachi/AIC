Project1

In this project, the objective is for you to go through the process of constructing and analyzing a dataset. Most 
of the time (including in our own classes), algorithms are talked about more than the data. However, to build 
good models in machine learning, you need good data to learn from. As a result, this is one aspect that usually 
consumes a large portion of efforts and resources when building models.
